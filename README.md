# peaceful-bot-for-ogame-and-or-clones-
An idea for peaceful development of an empire, planet by planet.

I am convinced I know what the bot has to do. I am absolutely sure I am not able to code it, yet.

So I will write the precode, as detailed as I can. And hope for experienced programmers to get involved.

To my knowledge, this could be coded in Python, Java, and PHP.

The bot is intended to be used in ogame, 2moons, SteemNova, and other ogame type implementations.

This project will be part of a more ambitious project, aiming at developing the accepted use of bots in existing games.
I believe creating and tweaking bots is a great way of acquiring coding skills. I also believe working with bots is a wonderful
way of coming up with new ideas for existing and non-existing programming problems.
