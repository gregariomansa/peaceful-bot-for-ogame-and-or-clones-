1 - CONNECT TO THE SERVER

The user is prompted with a web page, asking for a user name and a password. This can be a .html file, a .php file, or any other
type.

I include a python 2 script that does this, though I have not been able to make it work yet. It is from a mine building bot for
ogame, deuxbot/ogame-bot. The name of the file is login.py.

There are many other possibilities, including ilinks (text only browser for linux), and different linux commands like curl,
wget or ssh.

2 - COLLECT DATA

There are no APIs available for these games. The most general solution for this would be to develop this API. This could, in fact,
be a project on it's own.

This does not seem to be necessary, though. The data could be scraped in many ways. There are a lot of packages available, and a lot
of scripts in different languages, like python and php. Only the required pieces of information could be gathered, which would be 
a minor percentage of the total information received by the player. The required individual data will show up in the following steps
of the bot.
